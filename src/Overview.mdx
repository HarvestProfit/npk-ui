## Introduction

NPK UI is a modern UI library designed to simplify the process of building user interfaces. 
By moving away from verbose class-based styling and embracing declarative components, NPK UI provides a 
more intuitive and flexible approach to designing UI structures.

## Key Features

### Declarative Components

NPK UI uses declarative components to design UI structures. This approach allows developers to define the 
desired outcome without worrying about the underlying implementation details. By using declarative components, 
we can create more readable and maintainable code.


Here's an example of a Card component in NPK UI:
```jsx
<Card>
  <Card.Header title="Summary" variant="plain">
    <Card.HeaderTrailingActions>
      <Button icon={MenuIcon} onClick={openMenu} />
    </Card.HeaderTrailingActions>
  </Card.Header>

  Some contents
</Card>
```

vs the equivalent in our current UI system:

```jsx
<Card className="shadow-sm">
  <CardHeader className="border-0 d-flex flex-row justify-content-between">
    <h5 className="mb-0">Summary</h5>
    <Button className="btn-icon" onClick={openMenu}>
      <Icon icon={MenuIcon} />
    </Button>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardBody>
    Some contents
  </CardBody>
</Card>
```

Overall the concept is the same, but the NPK UI version has a lot less variables (classNames) to keep track of. As a result,
if we wanted to change the style of our cards, we wouldn't be able to easily tell if all of the card styles would change due to
this verbosity.

### Theming

One of the significant advantages of using declarative components is the ease of controlling the theme of the software. 
NPK UI allows for the creation of additional themes, such as high contrast or dark mode, with minimal effort. 
This flexibility ensures that the UI can adapt to different user preferences and accessibility needs. This is all 
thanks to the use of CSS variables which were not availble in bootstrap 4. Our CSS file as a whole should be significantly
smaller as well.

### Accessibility and Best Practices

NPK UI components are designed with accessibility and best practices in mind. By incorporating features like tooltips,
we can ensure that our components are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, but maybe more importantly
all our users can benefit from some good practices of helpful tooltips around the app. 
This focus on accessibility helps create a better user experience.

It's as simple as this!
```jsx
<Button icon={MenuIcon} onClick={openMenu} aria-label="Open Menu" />
```

or this!
```jsx
<div aria-describedby="tooltip-id">
  Something obscure
</div>
<Tooltip id="tooltip-id" content="More info on that obscure thing!" />
```

### CSS Modules and CSS Variables

NPK UI styles are built using CSS modules and CSS variables. This was chosen for the purpose of restricting styles to the
specific components they are working with and master stylesheet styles will not impact them. This means all our buttons/cards/etc will
be the same! And the use of CSS variables allows us to simply load in a new stylesheet of variables to change the entire look of the app.
No more duplicating our entire bootstrap Grid system just to support a collapsed nav bar (yes that's actually how that currently works - literally doubles our CSS file size).

## Conclusion

NPK UI offers a modern and flexible approach to building user interfaces. By leveraging declarative components, theming capabilities, 
accessibility features, and advanced styling techniques, NPK UI simplifies the development process and ensures a consistent and 
accessible user experience.
