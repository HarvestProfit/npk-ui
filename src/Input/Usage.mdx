# Input

Inputs require a label to be accessible. You'll get warnings if you do not add the `aria-label` prop or the `aria-labelledby` prop in conjunction with an `id` prop to a label node.

### Default

A styled input that can be used for text.
You can also use the same `leadingVisual` and `trailingVisual` props as the `Button` component.
The biggest change is that you can also put a button in as those visuals to allow for added actions.

### Number

Numeric inputs only allow for numeric values to be entered in. You can use things like `minValue` and `maxValue` to limit 
the range of values that can be entered, or `minimumFractionDigits` and `maximumFractionDigits` to limit the number of decimal places.
You can also use the `type` prop to set the input type to `number`, `currency`, or `percentage`. The `currency` and `percentage` types 
will automatically format the input value as a currency or percentage, respectively. The `number` type will not format the input value, 
but will still only allow numeric values to be entered.

<br />
Here's a few examples of how you can set up different inputs. I think the best looking are where you put the symbol
in the `leadingVisual` or `trailingVisual` props. This way the symbol is always visible and the input contents
aren't changing as much.
<em>If you use the `type="currency"` prop, this will automatically pull the currency symbole from the theme context and set it as the leading visual.</em>

### Groups

You can group inputs together into segments by wrapping inputs in the `<Input.Group>` component. The rule of thumb is 
to only be grouping things that are part of the same input. For example a price plus a unit can be grouped. I wouldn't do
first and last name grouped together though as the UX is misleading since there is no visual separation between the two.

### Masking
You can mask inputs to only allow certain characters to be entered. You can use the `mask` prop to set the mask to a 
string of characters that are allowed to be entered. There are some calendar and a `number` mask that are built in, but you can
also create your own masks by implementing a function that returns an object with keys `mask` which contains an array of rules, and
`formatter` which will format the input value on blur. Here is an example of a custom phone number mask.
