# Cards


### Default
<small>Use: General</small>

Cards are a great way to group related information together. You should remember to set the <code>as</code> prop
on the <code>Card.Header</code> component to set the header element in accordance with the importance on the page. 
It will not change the size, use the <code>size</code> prop to change the size of the header.

`Card.Divider` is a great way to separate content in a card.

### Plain Header
<small>Use: minimalistic cards</small>

Not every card needs a border, the plain header allows you to create a minimalistic card.
<Canvas of={CardStories.PlainHeader} />

### Inset Header
<small>Use: form sections</small>

Great for creating sections in a form
<Canvas of={CardStories.InsetForForms} />

### Muted Cards
<small>Use: simple summaries</small>

Greate for key value pairs or simple summaries
<Canvas of={CardStories.Muted} />

### Invisible Cards
<small>Use: report cards</small>

Useful for creating report card sections on a page like a summary.
<Canvas of={CardStories.Invisible} />

### Sizes
<small>Use: General</small>

Change the <code>size</code> prop to change the size of the header. The default is <code>md</code>.
Change the <code>as</code> prop to change the header element. The default is <code>h3</code>.

### Cards also play nice with tab navs
<small>Use: toggling between different states</small>

To simplify a feature, you can use tab navs to jump between different screens in a card. Cards and Tab Navs are built to
work together.

### Sticky Headers

Sometimes the header of the card is important for context, especially in long cards. You can make the header sticky by setting the
<code>sticky</code> prop to <code>true</code>. This will stick the header to the top of the screen when scrolling. Table Headers
will adjust automatically
