# Tables


### Default

Tables are built to work well with cards and other components. They support truncating values and clickable/expandable rows.

Here's an example of a table with a few rows and columns including a table section.

*Table Subsections* can be built using the `scope="row"` prop on the `th` element with the colSpan attribute.

You can also use the `data-type="number"` attribute on `td` and `th` elements to indicate that the value is a number. This will align the values correctly.

You can also add some metrics above the table with the `Table.Metrics` component.
<Canvas of={TableStories.WithCounterMetrics} />

### Cards
Tables can exist inside cards with or without a card header.

### Clickable and Expandable Rows
Tables can have clickable rows and expandable rows. To make the entire table clickable, set the `aria-role="treegrid"` on the table.
A treegrid is basically like a file explorer, it allows clicking to open or expand a row. 

The table role sets each row to be clickable if they have an `aria-level="1"` (this is assumed if not provided). You can disable
a row from being clickable by setting `aria-disabled="true"` on the row.

When expanding a row, the `aria-expanded` attribute is set to `true` on the row which allows it to be clicked no matter its level.
New expanded rows should be added as a new row with the `aria-level` incremented by 1. If this row can be expanded but is not,
set the `aria-expanded` attribute to `false` on the row. This allows the user to click on the row to expand it.

### Truncated Values
You can either truncate all values in the table with the `truncate` prop, or you can use the `data-truncate` attribute on each table cell.
This is shortcutted with the `truncate` prop on the `Table.Td` component.

### Loading States

Loading states in tables can easier be built by simply swapping the data values with the `Placeholder` component.
You can also use the `Table.Loading` component with the `rows` and `columns` props to generate a basic loading table of that size.
