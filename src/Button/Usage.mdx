# Buttons


### Default
<small>Use: General</small>

Default buttons should be used for everything by default. These are made to look clickable.
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Default} />

### Primary
<small>Use: Primary Actions</small>

Primary buttons should be used to indicate a call to action, indicating to the user that it is the
main way to interact with the content.
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

### Danger
<small>Use: Destructive Actions</small>

Danger buttons should be used to indicate a destructive action. 
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Danger} />

### Groups
<small>Use: Collections of similar actions</small>

Button groups are used for collections of filters, or multipart actions (like a primary button with a dropdown button for more primary actions).
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Groups} />

### Elevated
<small>Use: Bulk Actions, Main CTA</small>

Elevated buttons are used to display actions on tables for things like bulk actions as well as 
`size="lg"` buttons which are used for the main CTA set of buttons on the top right of the page.
**Do not mix invisible and elevated.**

These buttons have a little shadow and is intended for them to stick out just a little bit more.
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Elevated} />

### Invisible
<small>Use: Minor Actions</small>

Invisible buttons are used as clickable elements while remaining minimal in the UI. This is good for
minor features and clickable items within blocks of text. **Do not mix invisible and elevated.**
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Invisible} />

### Icon Buttons
**All icons buttons should use `aria-label` to specify a tooltip.**. These are great for buttons that take up minimal
amount of size. A warning will be logged to the console if the tooltip is missing.
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.IconButtons} />

### Tooltips & Buttons
You can specify the `aria-label` prop to add a tooltip to a button. You can also use the `aria-describedby`
prop and a tooltip with an id to link them together.
