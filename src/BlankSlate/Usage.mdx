# Blank Slates
Blank slates represent an empty state on a page. This will tell users how to populate the page.

The <code>BlankSlate.Description</code> component should <em>always</em> be added to a blank slate to add context
as to why the state is blank and what the user can do about it. Additionally, the <code>BlankSlate.Actions</code> component
should also be used to provide users a next step on how to populate the page.

### Default
<small>Use: General</small>

<Canvas of={BlankSlateStories.Default} />

### Normal (No Border)
The default is without a border and is great as a stand alone item on a page telling the user what actions they 
should take to fill the page.
<Canvas of={BlankSlateStories.Normal} />

### Border
Blank Slates with borders are great when there are other components on the page and you need to section things up
a bit.
<Canvas of={BlankSlateStories.Border} />

### Visuals

Providing the <code>BlankSlate.Visual</code> component with a large icon allows you to break up the page/text a bit with
some fun representable image. This isn't always needed but can be nice.

<b>If a large icon isn't available in this package, use a <em>light</em> icon from font awesome with a font size of 2.5rem</b>.

<Canvas of={BlankSlateStories.Visuals} />
