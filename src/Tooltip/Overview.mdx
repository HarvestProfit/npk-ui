# Tooltips

*You must have the `ThemeContextProvider` in the parent tree and configure the `prependRootId` option for this to work (attaches to the app through a React Portal).*
 
Tooltips are attached via a portal and uses `@floating-ui` (previously popper) to position the tooltip in the correct position.

You can attach a tooltip to an element via a ref or by simply providing an id to the tooltip. The ID needs to match the `aria-describedby` attribute
on the element you want the tooltip to connect to.

Tooltips can also be rendered on bodies of text.

<Canvas of={TooltipStories.TextBlock} />
