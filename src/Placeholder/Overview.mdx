# Placeholder
 
Used to render a loading skeleton view by replacing content with loading blocks.

Placeholders will automatically assume the height of the parent element via its text size and text color. Width is based on the
`width` prop you give it. You can specify an array where the first integer is the min value and the second is the max value to 
generate a random value.
