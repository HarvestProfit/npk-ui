# Badges

### Default
Badges are used to tag something visually like a status or a category. Usually they are not
meant to be interactive or to have icons but can be used in the same way as buttons if needed. This includes
the ability to be clickable and add leading/trailing visuals and loading states.
<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Colors} />

### Feature Previews

To indicate to the user that they are using a preview feature, the color <code>preview</code> should be used. This
is currently synonymous with the color <code>purple</code> but may change in the future.
<Canvas of={BadgeStories.FeaturePreviews} />

### Clickable

When you provide an <code>onClick</code> prop, the badge will have hover and active states plus a pointer cursor.
