# Navigation


### Primary Navigation
Primary navigation is bold and important. It utilizes `Nav.Group` to group the navigation items. **Groups are required**
for the primary navigation. You do not need to include a title for the group but it should have an `aria-label` to make
sure it is labeled correctly.

<Canvas of={NavStories.Primary} />

### Underline Navigation
Underline navigation is used on most pages. These cannot use groups.

<Canvas of={NavStories.Underline} />

### Secondary Navigation
This is pretty much only used in settings or anywhere else that you would have a panel with a vertical navigation.
This is best to not use since it conflicts with the primary navigation.

<Canvas of={NavStories.Secondary} />

### Nav.Button icons
Using icons from this library may come with a filled or non-filled version. `Nav.Button` will automatically choose
the filled icon when active. Otherwise you will need to use the pattern `leadingVisual={({ active }) => active ? FilledIcon : RegularIcon}`.

Check out the examples to see how this works.
