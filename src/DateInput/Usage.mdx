# Date Input


### Default

Date Input allows you to type in a date in controlled segments.
You can also use the same `leadingVisual` and `trailingVisual` props as the `Button` component.
The biggest change is that you can also put a button in as those visuals to allow for a date picker and other things.

#### NOTE about timezones
If you are working with a date that does NOT store the time, you must remember to exclude the time
part of ISO string before sending to the database. Otherwise the time part will get stripped and anything remaining
will be stored. For example "2025-01-01T18:00:00+01100" will be stored as "2025-01-01", but it actually should be 
stored as "2025-01-02" because of the timezone change.

You can fix this by making sure the value provided to these components is only "2025-01-01" in which case you will 
only ever recieve a date only ISO string in the onChange. Or you can provide the prop `isoType="Date"` to force it to
return a specific type, this is useful for initial values like `value={new Date()} isoType="Date"`.

### Date Range

You can also do date ranges the same way
<Canvas of={DateInputStories.Range} />

### Time

You can also enter in times using the same format
<Canvas of={DateInputStories.Time} />

### Calendar Button Popup

If you just want a button to open a calendar picker, you can use the `Calendar` component with the
`Menu` component to create a popup calendar. You can also just use the `Calendar` component directly
to create a calendar that is always open.
<Canvas of={DateInputStories.CalendarButton} />

### Granularity

Using the granularity prop you can specify how precise the input should be
<Canvas of={DateInputStories.Granularity} />
