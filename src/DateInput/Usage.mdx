# Date Input


### Default

Date Input allows you to type in a date in controlled segments.
You can also use the same `leadingVisual` and `trailingVisual` props as the `Button` component.
The biggest change is that you can also put a button in as those visuals to allow for a date picker and other things.

### Date Range

You can also do date ranges the same way
<Canvas of={DateInputStories.Range} />

### Time

You can also enter in times using the same format
<Canvas of={DateInputStories.Time} />

### Calendar Button Popup

If you just want a button to open a calendar picker, you can use the `Calendar` component with the
`Menu` component to create a popup calendar. You can also just use the `Calendar` component directly
to create a calendar that is always open.
<Canvas of={DateInputStories.CalendarButton} />

### Granularity

Using the granularity prop you can specify how precise the input should be
<Canvas of={DateInputStories.Granularity} />
